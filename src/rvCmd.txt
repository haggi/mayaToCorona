This is how it is supposed to work:

1. a render view update process is started via MTimerMessage callback 
2. a renderProcess() is started in a seperate thread.
3. during rendering and while MRenderView::endRender is not called, the render view update process updates the renderView from black to blue
4. after rendering is done another thread updates the color which should be displayed in the render view from black to white.

--> the renderView does not recognzite the postRenderProcess updates any more.
